# Secure Horoscope App

This is a simple daily horoscope web application that uses Google's Gemini AI to generate forecasts.

The project is structured to be securely deployed on Vercel, protecting the Google AI API key by using a serverless function.

## How to Deploy

      - **Value:** Paste your secret API key from Google AI Studio here.
